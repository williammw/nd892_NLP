    "In this notebook, sections that end with **'(IMPLEMENTATION)'** in the header indicate that the following blocks of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this notebook, you will build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. Your completed pipeline will accept English text as input and return the French translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Preprocess** - You'll convert text to sequence of integers.\n",
    "- **Models** Create models which accepts a sequence of integers as input and returns a probability distribution over possible translations. After learning about the basic types of neural networks that are often used for machine translation, you will engage in your own investigations, to design your own model!\n",
    "- **Prediction** Run the model on English text."

    "We begin by investigating the dataset that will be used to train and evaluate your pipeline.  The most common datasets used for machine translation are from [WMT](http://www.statmt.org/).  However, that will take a long time to train a neural network on.  We'll be using a dataset we created for this project that contains a small vocabulary.  You'll be able to train your model in a reasonable time with this dataset.\n",

    "This project focuses on learning various network architectures for machine translation, but we don't evaluate the models according to best practices by splitting the data into separate test & training sets -- so the model accuracy is overstated. Use the [`sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split()`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html) function to create separate training & test datasets, then retrain each of the models using only the training set and evaluate the prediction accuracy using the hold out test set. Does the \"best\" model change?"
